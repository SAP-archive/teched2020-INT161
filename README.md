## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called INT161 - Detect and Highlight Entities from Unstructured Text Using Machine Learning.  

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to the Business Entity Recognition service. Business Entity Recognition helps to detect and highlight any given type of named entity in unstructured text and classify it in accordance with predefined categories. You can use this artificial intelligence business service, for example, to automatically extract the context from incoming emails with invoice inquiries, automating recurring tasks associated with answering queries about the status and payment of invoices.
The service includes pre-trained models that are immediately productive. There is also a provision to build your own custom models to extract the entities based on your requirements.

## Requirements
